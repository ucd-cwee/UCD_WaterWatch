// By all accounts, the Installer should produce a working installation tool. Currently, it fails silently and will not make a working VSTO.
// The current means of distribution is to copy all of the ../bin/Release/.. content to a ZIP file, and have the end-user run a BAT or run the VSTO directly. 
// The installer is supposed to do the hard work of making sure the needed dependancies are present... which is why this should be fixed in the future for a more robust install experience.
